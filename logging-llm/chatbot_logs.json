This data can include information like:\n\n1. Caller ID: The phone number of the person making the call.\n2. Call duration: How long the call lasted.\n3. Call date and time: When the call was made.\n4. Script navigation: A record of which menu options were selected, in what order.\n5. Answer/hold times: The amount of time spent on the line before a call is answered or put on hold.\n\nThe IVR trace typically includes recordings of the entire conversation, allowing you to:\n\n1. Identify specific issues or points of contention with customer service representatives.\n2. Review and troubleshoot technical problems related to your phone system.\n3. Identify areas where customers are getting stuck in the IVR menu system due to unclear answers or missing menus.\n\nThese records serve several purposes, including:\n\n1. Quality monitoring: To ensure that customer service agents provide good quality services.\n2. Call center auditing: To improve and improve staff training and call handling\n3. Policy management: To develop and track business policies\n\nIn many cases, the IVR log is often retained for a specific period and can be accessed through various channels (online portal, email, or sometimes, by accessing the phone company\u2019s customer account).", "metadata": {"session_id": "eca5b50a-4069-4206-9702-5a1eda672ec5", "model": "llama3.2:3b", "response_time_seconds": 62.341744, "tokens_used": 366}}
